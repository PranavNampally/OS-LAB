No Virtual will be valid when then limit for both the segments is set to 0 each and also bases can be initialized to 0 each.
That is,
-l=0
-L=0
which is same as,
--l0=0
--l1=0

Then there won't be any space allocated to any of the segments so all VAs will be invalid in such a case.

Command: python2 segmentation.py -b 0 -l 0 -B 0 -L 0
