We know that,
Size of Page Table = Address Space Size / Page Size
So, we see that as Address Space Size increases then the Page Table size also increases.(as they are directly proportional)
And when  Page size increases then the Page Table size decreases.(as they are inversely proportional)
Using big pages in general will cause wastage of space especially a scenario of Internal Fragmentation.
